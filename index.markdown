title: Gilles de Hollander, Brain Scientist

I am a cognitive neuroscientist based at the Zurich Center for Neuroeconomics
(ZNE) at the University of Zurich (UZH).

I have a degree in **Artificial Intelligence** and did my PhD in the field of
**ultra-high field (UHF) MRI** at field strengths of 7 Tesla and more
with Prof. Birte Forstmann at the University of Amsterdam.
I am convinced that UHF-fMRI has the potential to transform the field of
humans neuroimaging, because the SNR is simply so much higher than at lower
field strengths, allowing us to analyse brain data in *individual space* and
at the *mesoscopic resolution* of subcortical nuclei, topographical maps,
cortical columns, and cortical layers.

During my first postdoc I got very excited about
the experimental rigor and vast knowledge in **visual neuroscience**
and the power of  **encoding models** that quantitatively model the
relationship between objective properties of the world (e.g., the number
f stimuli in a stimulus array) and neural activity. By inverting such
models, we can track which information the brain has access to from
moment-to-moment. I think this is a very useful measure to learn more about
how brain actually works.

At the ZNE, I work on the question of **how the quirks of simple,
everyday (economic) decisions are rooted in fundamental brain properties**.
To me, a central and fundamental property of the brain is that is uses its
representational capacity only where it is most needed.
This has profound consequences for economic
choice behavior. For example:
* **People have trouble understanding the objective magnitude of large numbers**:
They tend to increasingly underestimate increasingly larger numbers.
 This has important consequences for how they make decisions
 where different numerical magnitudes play a role.
* **Neural representations of the outside world are very noisy**. Thus, People
need to take into account this noise when they make decisions about the
outside world.
* **People can meaningfully attend only one thing at at time**. Thus,
what people attend at a given moment in time has a huge influence
on how they make decisions. Analogously, neural representations of the
outside world are to a large extent shaped by attention as well.

In my research, I try to formalise and empirically test such hypotheses
using experiments involving *human subjects* and
*whole-brain UHF-fMRI measurements*.
