abstract: "Risk preferences—the willingness to accept greater uncertainty to achieve larger potential rewards—determine many aspects of our lives and are often interpreted as a stable individual trait. However, this perspective does not explain why risk preferences can vary substantially across contexts and even across repetitions of the same decisions. We provide modeling and neural evidence that contextual shifts and moment-to-moment fluctuations in risk preferences emerge from Bayesian inference on noisy magnitude representations in parietal cortex. In our fMRI study, participants chose between safe and risky options that were either held in working memory or visible on the screen. Risk aversion increased for large payoffs and risk-seeking for small payoffs when options were in working memory, explained by Bayesian central tendency biases. Behavioural and neural data, including population-receptive field modelling, demonstrated that noisier intraparietal representations led to less consistent and less risk-neutral choices, suggesting reliance on prior beliefs about payoffs. These findings highlight that risk preferences and their fluctuations are mechanistically rooted in perceptual inference on noisy parietal magnitude representations, with broad implications for economic, psychological, and neuroscience theories of risk-taking behavior."
