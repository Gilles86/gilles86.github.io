abstract: "Our understanding of the complex interplay between structural and functional organisation of brain networks is
being advanced by the development of novel multi-modal analyses approaches. The Age-ility Project
(Phase 1) data repository offers open access to structural MRI, diffusion MRI, and resting-state fMRI scans, as
well as resting-state EEG recorded from the same community participants (n = 131, 15â€“35 y, 66 male). Raw imaging and electrophysiological data as well as essential demographics are made available via the NITRC website.
All data have been reviewed for artifacts using a rigorous quality control protocol and detailed case notes are
provided."
