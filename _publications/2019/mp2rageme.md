abstract: "Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging generates images of meaningful physical or chemical variables measured in physical units that allow quantitative comparisons between tissue regions and among subjects scanned at the same or different sites. Here, we show that we can acquire quantitative T1, T2*, and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) information in a single acquisition, using a multi-echo (ME) extension of the second gradient-echo image of the MP2RAGE sequence. This combination is called MP2RAGE ME, or MP2RAGEME. The simultaneous acquisition results in large time savings, perfectly coregistered data, and minimal image quality differences compared to separately acquired data. Following a correction for residual transmit B1+-sensitivity, quantitative T1, T2*, and QSM values were in excellent agreement with those obtained from separately acquired, also B1+-corrected, MP2RAGE data and ME gradient echo data. The quantitative values from reference regions of interests were also in very good correspondence with literature values. From the MP2RAGEME data, we further derived a multiparametric cortical parcellation, as well as a combined arterial and venous map. In sum, our MP2RAGEME sequence has the benefit in large time savings, perfectly coregistered data and minor image quality differences."
