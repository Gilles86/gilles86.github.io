abstract: "We perceive a stable visual world across eye movements, despite the drastic retinal transients these movements produce. To explain visual spatial stability, it has been suggested that the brain encodes the location of attended visual stimuli in an external, or spatiotopic, reference frame. However, spatiotopy is seemingly at odds with the fundamental retinotopic organization of visual inputs. Here, we probe the spatial reference frame of vision using ultra-high-field (7T) fMRI and single-voxel population receptive field mapping, while independently manipulating both gaze direction and spatial attention. Participants performed visual tasks that manipulated spatial attention and gaze direction to dissociate retinal from real-world stimulus positions. Our findings show that population receptive fields shift with gaze, consistent with a fully retinotopic reference frame for visual-spatial processing, even when using Bayesian decoding of BOLD responses. These results suggest that vision relies on a retinotopic frame of reference throughout the visual cortex, irrespective of spatial attention deployment."
