abstract: "Conscious perception alternates between the two eyes’ images during binocular rivalry. How hierarchical processes in our brain interact to resolve visual competition to generate conscious perception remains unclear. Here we investigated the mesoscale neural circuitry for binocular rivalry in human cortical and subcortical areas using high-resolution functional MRI at 7 Tesla. Eye-specific response modulation in binocular rivalry was strongest in the superficial layers of V1 ocular dominance columns (ODCs), and more synchronized in the superficial and deep layers. The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) generated stronger eye-specific response modulation and increased effective connectivity to the early visual cortex during binocular rivalry compared to monocular “replay” simulations. Although there was no evidence of eye-specific rivalry modulation in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, strong perceptual rivalry modulation can be found in its parvocellular (P) subdivision. Finally, IPS and ventral pulvinar showed robust perceptual rivalry modulation and increased connectivity to the early visual cortex. These findings demonstrate that local interocular competition arises from lateral mutual inhibition between V1 ODCs, and feedback signals from IPS to visual cortex and visual thalamus further synchronize and resolve visual competition to generate conscious perception."
