I am a cognitive neuroscientist based at the [Zurich Center for Neuroeconomics
(ZNE)](https://www.zne.uzh.ch/en.html) at the University of Zurich (UZH).

My main research aim is to understand how **humans make simple everyday decisions**
and how their **decisions are shaped by fundamental properties of brain architecture**.
