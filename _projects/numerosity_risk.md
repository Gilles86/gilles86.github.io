In this project, we aim to better understand the *perceptual foundations*
of risky decision-making. When choosing between safer and riskier options,
human subjects tend to choose safer options â€“even when the expected
(average) payoff of such options is lower. Why do subjects choose like this?
Classical economic theories like
[expected utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis)
and [prospect theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory) suggest
this has to do with *valuation*: subjects don't *like* the riskier options.

We explore a complementary hypothesis: that risk aversion is (also) rooted
in *perception*: subject do not completely ''grasp'' the larger payoffs magnitude of
riskier options, because their perception is *noisy* and *biased*.
In many domains such as numerosity, loudness, weight, and brightness,
people tend to underestimate large magnitudes. So why would this be different
for monetary magnitudes?
This notion is formalized in a theoretical Framework developed by
[Khaw, Li and Woodford](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24978).

<em>Numerical receptive field models</em> measure to which numbers different
patches of cortex are most responsive. It turns out that neurons in parietal
cortex are sensitive to different numbers (<em>number parietal cortex, NPC</em>).
Hence, they are a good target reason
when one is interested in the neural representations that humans are using
during economic decisions.

We built upon their work by using *numerical encoding models* that describe
how neural activity in parietal cortex, as measured using fMRI, represents
the numerosity of currently attended stimuli. These models are called
*numerical population receptive field models* and built upon
[seminal work](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1239052)
by Ben Harvey and Serge Dumoulin at Utrecht University.

Using such numerical encoding models, we showed that *subjects that have
particularly noisy numerical representations in parietal cortex*, are also
*particularly risk-averse*. This aligns with theoretical
predictions of the model of Khaw et al.: the more noisy an individual's
perception is, the more he/she will revert to her priors/biases.

Currently, we are replicating these findings using 7T fMRI, to see if
fluctuations in the fidelity of numerical representations can also predict
trial-to-trial fluctuations in risk aversion.
