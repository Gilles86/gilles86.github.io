Using the increased SNR of 7T MRI combined with *surface coils (built with
smaller coil elements that are placed very close to the skull), we can obtain
functional MRI at an unprecedented resolution of 0.7 mm. This allowed us
to measure individual maps of visual cortex that describe how the outside
world is represented. Specifically, we visualized both *ocular dominance
columns* (ODCs) and *retinotopic maps*. So for each patch of primary
visual cortex, we could visualize (1) to which part of the visual
field and (2) to which single eye that patch of cortex was most sensitive.

In this experiment, we mapped out the sensitivity of neurons in primary
visual cortex (V1) to different parts of the visual field, as well as
different eye using fMRI.
<strong>(A)</strong> our field of view only included the occipital pole
and thereby the foveal parts of V1. The data was carefully registered
to a 0.64mm T1-weighted anatomical image.
<strong>(B)</strong> We performed a standard PRF mapping paradigm and
PRF model to quantify to which parts of the visual field different
patches of V1 were most sensitive. This allowed us to relate
columnar patterns to retinotopy, as well as define the border between V1
and V2 by the charachteristic phase reversals in retinotopy.
<strong>(C)</strong> By presenting flickering checkerboards seperately
to the two eyes, contained by a salient frame that helped eye convergence,
we could map out ocular dominance columns: little ~1mm-wide stripes of
corte that are particularly sensitive to the left or right eye.

Moreover, due to the 0.7mm resolution, we could also dissociate fMRI activity
across different *laminae*. Specifically, we could show that whereas differential
input to the eyes mainly affected the fMRI signal at deep and middle
depth, corresponding to infragranular and granular layer, an attentional
manipulation almost exclusively impacted signal at superficial depth, corresponding
to supragranular layers. Crucially, these findings nicely mirror findings in
electrophysiological recordings in rodents and non-human primates, as well as
neuroanatomical tracing studies that show that feedback projections
largely terminate in supragranular layers, whereas feedforward and sensory
input largely terminates in granular and infragranular layers.

In sum, this project was a nice illustration of the potential of 7T fMRI
to move beyond golfball-sized "blobs" in an MNI standard space, and move
towards individualized neuroimaging that focuses on individual *representations*
of the outside world.
